❤️ Be My Valentine – Interactive Web Fun

A playful Valentine’s Day web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This interactive page asks the classic question — “Will you be my Valentine?” — with a fun twist:
The “No” button refuses to be clicked and keeps escaping
Clicking “Yes” triggers a sweet celebration with a GIF, sound, and floating heart animations
Designed with a clean, modern UI and smooth interactions

✨ Features
Responsive, aesthetic card design
Playful “No” button movement
Sound effects for interactions
Celebration GIF on “Yes”
Soft, randomized floating heart particles
No libraries — pure HTML, CSS, and JS
